Code before the commit a5324c49102194e62b2571ec0663d760a84ea390 *may* be available under the Unlicense.

Note: It is in our non-expert opinion that Unlicense is not a valid license due to the lack of a proper fallback clause.
Beware that this may affect your rights if you intend to use it in a region where the Public Domain does not exist,
or is more restrictive than simply using All Rights Reserved code and assets.
