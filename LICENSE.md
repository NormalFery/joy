# Joy Licenses

Joy is licensed differently depending on which component you are looking at.
Read carefully, this may affect how you may use and distribute Joy.

## Code

[All Rights Reserved][CODE].

Code before the commit a5324c49102194e62b2571ec0663d760a84ea390 *may* be available under the Unlicense.

Note: It is in our non-expert opinion that Unlicense is not a valid license due to the lack of a proper fallback clause.
Beware that this may affect your rights if you intend to use it in a region where the Public Domain does not exist,
or is more restrictive than simply using All Rights Reserved code and assets.

Pride Blahajs were taken from [musicalskele] under the [MIT License][BLAHAJ-PRIDE].

*Note: This is operating under assumptions from known and disclosed sources.*
